# How to launch

To run the code you need install the `graphics` and `tkinter` libraries.

After you have run the file `mathematicalPendulum.py` you will see a window:

In this window, you can configure the parameters of the pendulum - the color of the ball, the mass of the ball, the radius of the ball, the length of the thread, the initial angle and the initial angular velocity.

When all the parameters are configured, click "RUN":

# Mathematical description

To calculate the deflection angle we use the following differential equation:

Where Î³ is an attenuation coefficient, omega_0 is a self-resonant frequency and k - is resistance coefficient:
