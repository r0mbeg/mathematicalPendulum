A model of a mathematical pendulum.

To run the code you need install the `graphics` and `tkinter` libraries.

To calculate the deflection angle we use the following differential equation:

Where Î³ is an attenuation coefficient, omega_0 is a self-resonant frequency and k - is resistance coefficient:

Knowing the initial conditions, we can calculate the acceleration:
